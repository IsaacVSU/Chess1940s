# SexistChess
This was original chess, when the queen was much weaker in the game. En passant didn't exist nor did Castling. However, just for the sake of having them, lets add them anyway. Basically modern chess but the queen changes.

# DISCLAIMER 
 “misogamy is bad and we do not endorse it, however we find it hilarious" ~ 2 guys

 # Ideas:
 - Queen's Curfew: If you play the game past 8pm the queen can’t move
 - Get Back in the Kitchen!: If queen ever check’s/ checkmate ‘s king, then the king can say “get back in the kitchen” and the opponent's queen has to return to the other side of the board. It’s UNO rules tho so the opponent HAS to say that phrase similar to saying UNO in Uno
 - To make it better (worse) when you take the Queen, you get to move again
 - Queen can only move 1 space diagnolly like traditional chess before the 1300s
 - The Pawns can only become Queens 
 - Queen's Belt: Sometimes the queen has to disaplin her kids, so to do so she uses her belt to lasso the a pawn back to their original position home or to the Queen, however the pawn can't be used for 2 turns because they have been spanked by momma Queen and their bousom stings. OUCH!
