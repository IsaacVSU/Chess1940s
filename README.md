# Chess1940s
This was original chess, when the queen was much weaker in the game. En passant didn't exist nor did Castling. However, just for the sake of having them, lets add them anyway. Basically modern chess but the queen changes.

# DISCLAIMER 
 “misogyny is horrible and we do not endorse it/ support it, however we find it hilarious" ~ 2 guys

 # Ideas:
 - Curfew: If you play the game past 8pm the queen can’t move
 - Get Back in the Kitchen!: If queen ever check’s/ checkmate ‘s king, then the king can say “get back in the kitchen” and the opponent's queen has to return to the other side of the board. It’s UNO rules tho so the opponent HAS to say that phrase similar to saying UNO in Uno
 - To make it better (worse) when you take the Queen, you get to move again
 - 1/3 Pay: Queen can only move 1 space diagnolly and straight like traditional chess before the 1300s
 - The Pawns can only become Queens 
 - Queen's Belt: Sometimes the queen has to disaplin her kids, so to do so she uses her belt to lasso the a pawn back to their original position home or to the Queen, however the pawn can't be used for 2 turns because they have been spanked by momma Queen and their bousom stings. OUCH!
 - Domain Expansion Women's Suffrage: When castling the Queen on the far walls of the game, The 3 rows or columns become a death plain, any pieces that are caught or move into the death plain are taken. So for example: a Rook on 8A and another on 8C, meanwhile the Queen in the middle on 8B, once achieved those three columns become death plains. Or a Rook on 6A and another on 4A, meanwhile the Queen in the middle on 5A, once achieved those three rows become death plains. All pieces are effected by this but Knights, due to their chivalry.
 - Mood Cycles: The Queen has four moods: 5% Anger, 10% Craving, 10% Horny, 15% Down in the Dumps, and 60% Jolly.
    - When Jolly, the Queen acts like she normally does.
    - When Down in the Dumps, the Queen is too sad and bedridden and refuses to move, lasts for 1 turn.
    - When Angry, DON'T GET CLOSE TO THE QUEEN, she will take all pieces, including her own, this can even lead to taking your own King, this lasts for 2 turns.
    - When Craving, if the Queen doesn't take a piece within 5 turns, then the Queen's Craving turns into Anger.
    - When Horny, if the Queen gets near your King, then a Pawn is spawned in place of a deceased one (Easter Egg: if she has a kids with the opponent, then it's the opponent's colored Pawn).
 - Gold Digger: If the the opponent's King moves next to your Queen and they have more pieces/ pieces of value, then the your Queen will switch sides.
 - Bad Driving: When you move your Queen, there is a 1% chance the Queen will move in a spot you didn't choose.
